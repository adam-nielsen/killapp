Killapp: Monitor a Windows program via a tray icon, and provide a
right-click menu to forcefully terminate it.

Purpose
-------
This utility monitors a process (a running .exe file) and allows it to be
easily terminated via a right-click menu in the system tray.  When the
application is terminated it is done so forcefully, in the same way as choosing
"End Task" in Task Manager, only the user does not require access to run the
Task Manager application.

It is intended for use in remote-access situations (such has Citrix) where
end-users typically do not have enough access to forcefully terminate
applications themselves.

Because of this, the application does not hang around to keep the session open.
If the process to monitor cannot be found within 10 seconds it will silently
exit, and it will automatically exit once the process terminates normally.

Usage
-----

Both the application to monitor and the icon to use in the tray must be
specified:

  killapp \target.exe trayicon.ico

This will wait for up to 10 seconds for target.exe to be loaded, and will use
trayicon.ico as the system tray icon.

"target.exe" is matched against the end of the full process path, so you can
include partial path matches in the event that there are multiple processes
with the same .exe name.  An example is folder\test.exe.  Avoid using
"test.exe" with no path at all, as this will match both "mytest.exe" and
"yourtest.exe" and so may result in an unexpected application being terminated.
Instead use "\test.exe" as this will match only test.exe loaded from any path.

Note that you cannot use drive letters as the full name being matched is of
the Windows kernel form:

  \Device\HarddiskVolume1\WINDOWS\explorer.exe
